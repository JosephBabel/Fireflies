# Fireflies

## About
This is my first independently created Unity project. I used 2D URP to create and animate the fireflies and implemented basic audio and game managers.

## Summary

Take control of a blue firefly and survive as long as possible against waves of red fireflies. Obtain points by eating yellow fireflies and stack up score multipliers over time.
